Welcome! My name is Dongrong Li. I am currently a PhD student at CUHK(Chinese University of Hong Kong) majoring in statistics.

I was born and raised in Guangzhou, China. In 2020, I graduated from Sun Yat-sen University as a bachelor of science. I majored in statistics during my undergraduate study.
